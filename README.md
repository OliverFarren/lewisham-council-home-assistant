# Lewisham Council Bin Collections — Home Assistant Integration

A [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) custom integration that adds waste collection
schedule sensors for Lewisham addresses to Home Assistant.

## What it provides

- A two-stage config flow: enter your postcode or street, then select your
  exact address. The UPRN is stored; no re-search is needed on restart.
- One `sensor` per waste stream (Food Waste, Recycling, Refuse) with
  `device_class: date` so the next collection date displays cleanly on
  dashboards.
- Attributes on each sensor: `frequency`, `day`, `next_collection_basis`,
  `days_until_collection` (integer), and `collection_in` (e.g. `"today"`,
  `"tomorrow"`, `"4 days"`).
- Clean entity IDs: `sensor.lewisham_council_food_waste` etc. — not tied to the
  address string.
- A single device per address, grouped in the HA device registry.
- Automatic polling every 12 hours via HA's shared coordinator pattern.
